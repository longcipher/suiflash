    //! Navi Protocol Adapter
    //!
    //! Integrates with Navi Protocol's flash loan functionality via:
    //! - flash_loan_with_ctx: Borrows liquidity and returns balance + receipt
    //! - flash_repay_with_ctx: Repays flash loan using receipt and repayment coin
    //!
    //! Key Features:
    //! - Currently 0.06% treasury fee (temporarily reduced from 0.2%)
    //! - 0% LP fee
    //! - Must repay within same transaction block
    //! - Supports all pools with borrowing enabled
